\section{Related Triangle Works}

\subsection{Brute Force}
Check every permutation of three nodes to see if they are connected.

\subsection{Count all triangles}
Shank and Wagner

\subsection{Streaming and semi-streaming algorithms}
Bar-Yossef, Kumar, and Sivakumar

\subsection{Optional: Other papers we were handed out in class}

\section{Related Works for the Background of this Paper}

\subsection{Eigenvalues}
Lovasz
Lanczos
Mihail and Papadimitriou
Harary and Schwenk

\section{Method}
The main idea of \cite{original} is the fact that the total number of triangles
in a graph is proportional to the sum of cubes of its adjacency matrix
eigenvalues.
